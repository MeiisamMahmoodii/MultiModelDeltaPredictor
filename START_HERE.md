## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM ALL PAPERS

### **Architectural Foundation**
- Transformers enable parallel processing and long-range dependencies
- RoPE encodes relative positions crucial for unordered causal graphs
- Hard MoE (via Gumbel) forces specialization, preventing collapse

### **Causal Discovery**
- h-function = trace(e^(A⊙A)) - d is a mathematical marvel
- NOTEARS made causal discovery differentiable (first in field)
- ISD-CP amortizes: train once, apply to many graphs instantly

### **Physics Learning**
- Twin-world variance reduction is brilliant (same noise in obs+interv)
- Fourier features unlock high-frequency functions
- Hybrid embeddings (Linear + Fourier + MLP) capture diverse physics

### **Optimization**
- AdamW > Adam (decoupled weight decay)
- SGDR with warm restarts beats constant learning rates
- Multi-dimensional curriculum > single-dimension

### **Interventional Data**
- Intervention ≠ Observation (Pearl's do-calculus)
- Interventional data breaks confounding
- Elements of Causal Inference is the bible for this
